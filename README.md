# Robot arm Hozarii

Here is a Github repository of our project: Hozarii.
This is a project for RNCP master 2 titles form YNOV ROBOTICS CAMPUS.

The Goal of this project is to realise a 6 axis robot with a budget of about 500$.
The Goal is to create a simple robot cheap and reliability and accuracy. The majority of the Robot is 3D printed.

This robot uses 6 steppers motor Nema (nema 17, 14 and 8) and they are driven by a SERVO42C magnetic encoder driver. 
The majority of the reducers are some cheap metalic reducers planetary find on aliexpress.

All the boom of the robot is available on this github and the total production of it is under 500$.

All the motor driver Servo42C are driving in UART chain with a single STM32F4. this robot is designed to be connected to a cumputer with a USB C cable.
